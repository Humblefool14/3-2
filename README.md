College Studies/Projects 

I am doing a course called Advance Digital Communication. 
The project is part of the coursework.The project is to work on recent advances and try to replicate the results. 
The project is meant as a learning step for research. There are somethings which I have understood as a result of this 
project. 

Research is hard. 
Without any hard dealine, we can go on forever without doing any work on our side. 
And cognitive radio is damn amazing. 

The first couple of months were a storm. Fundamentals of Cognitive radio by Simon Haykin, the book is amazing. 
It was intense for me.
